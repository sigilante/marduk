"""
BPLAN named-op dependencies of the Gallowglass codegen.

Per `DECISIONS.md §"Upstream PLAN authority"`, the canonical PLAN spec is
`vendor/reaver/src/hs/Plan.hs`. PLAN proper and the Plan Asm text format are
frozen; the BPLAN named-op set may drift over time.

This module enumerates every BPLAN intrinsic that gallowglass-emitted code
relies on, by name and arity. `tests/sanity/test_bplan_deps.py` greps the
pinned `vendor/reaver/src/hs/Plan.hs` and asserts presence at the right arity.
This is the canary that fires when `vendor.lock` is bumped to a Reaver SHA
that has renamed, removed, or rearity'd one of our deps.

Each entry: `name -> arity`.

Categories:
  Core primitives — needed by codegen for opcode-equivalent operations.
  Arithmetic/bytes — needed by Core.Nat / Core.Text / Core.Bytes prelude.
  RPLAN — needed for I/O (deferred; see Phase G).
